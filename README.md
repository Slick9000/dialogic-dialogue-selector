# dialogic-dialogue-selector
a script which enables dialogue selection and highlighting with up and down inputs.

i believe in the future dialogic will make this work natively, but for now, dialogue selection in dialogic is not natively supported.

here's a fairly simple script which solves this.

that's it! this script interacts with the Dialogic.Choices through signals and will automatically function.
any modification, fork etc is welcome.

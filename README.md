# dialogic-dialogue-selector
a script which enables dialogue selection and highlighting with up and down inputs.

i believe in the future dialogic will make this work natively, but for now, dialogue selection in dialogic is not natively supported.
<br>
here's a fairly simple dialogic extension script which solves this.

## â˜• donations

while completely optional, it would be highly appreciated if you could donate if you find this script helpful!
it can be of any amount.

## usage

- create an extension in the dialogue extensions creator (see attached)
<br>

this will create a folder "dialogic_addons" if it did not already exist in your `res://addons/dialogic_additions` directory, and add a folder with the extension name.

- paste the code into the generated file (for me, i named the extension `DialogueSelector`, so my file is named `event_dialogue_selector.gd`)
<br>

that's it! the script will automatically work (if not, restart the engine).

any modification, fork etc is welcome.
